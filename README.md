## Requirements

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparation
You can download the CT-RATE and CTRG-Chest datasets used in this work via the Hugging Face repository (https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibrahimhamamci/CT-RATE) and Github (https://github.com/tangyuhao2016/CTRG).

The project structure should be:
```

```

## Pre-training

### 1. Pre-processing

Run the following command to pre-process the data:

```angular2
python prepro/prepro_pretraining_data.py
```

to get the following arrow files:

```angular2
root:[data]
+--pretrain_arrows
| +--clm_chest_ctrg_train.arrow
| +--clm_chest_ctrg_val.arrow
| +--clm_chest_ctrg_test.arrow
| +--clm_ct_rate_train.arrow
| +--clm_ct_rate_val.arrow
| +--clm_ct_rate_test.arrow
```

### 2. Pre-training

Now we can start to pre-train the ptunifer model:

```angular2
Single GPU:
bash run_scripts/pretrain.sh

Multiple GPUs:
bash run_scripts/pretrain_multi_gpus.sh
```
